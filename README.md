# PokemonApp

This is a tutorial app for MAD's Advanced Android workshop. This app demostrates how to make an Android app from a simple API using Square's [Retrofit library](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) and Paul Hallett's sweet [Pokemon API](http://pokeapi.co/).

### Components
 - [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
 - JSON Libraries
 - Network Calls
 - Simple APIs
 - What else did you want?
 
### Installation
**Step 1: Clone Repo** 

Open your terminal and type these commands.
```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] pokemon
$ cd pokemon
```
**Step 2: Open in Android Studio**

Download the latest Android Studio if you haven't. Open file as New Project.

**Step 3: Party**
Seriously, that's it.
